                                dynamic soundtrack. For example, the tone changes when in combat and back to calm
                                when the last enemy dies. More nuanced games will add a little more, such as RDR's
                                interweaving tracks between country transitions.
                            </p></li>

                                reflects the players current area. The speed and layers increase during specific
                                events. Ex.. when a train is speeding up/slowing down the track speed follows.
                                This can be seen in almost all of their work.

                                Be on the lookout for transitional events that would be suited for a dynamic track.
                                The soundtrack should not hinder the gameplay in any way. However it should make
                                your game feel better layered and cinematic. Should add character to the
                                play-style of your game. Mario = Playful, Zelda = Adventureous

                                Adaptive soundtracks should not only add this secondary texture to the game,
                                but can help out in many cases. Ex.. when a successful solution is found in
                                Portal 2, a layer is added onto the track to signify to the player they are
                                 heading in the right direction.

                                Metroidvania games generally feature a large interconnected world map the player
                                can explore, though access to parts of the world is often limited by doors or other
                                portals that can only be opened after the player has acquired special items, tools,
                                weapons or abilities within the game.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                The design of these Metroidvania games is usually hindered however because the goal
                                is to make the player feel like they are on a completely open path of their
                                choosing , when really they are on a linear path dictated by the items and power
                                ups in their arsenal.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                TT2 has an interesting design because they have a whole system based strictly on
                                two core gamplay moves. There are other things the player can do that don't directly
                                effect gameplay such as veiwing a map or taking a picture. Any puzzle in the game
                                can be solved with just a combination and knowledge of these two core moves.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                The tutorial also benefits from these simple moves because it gives the player
                                the chance to learn and digest these moves before being able to move on. The
                                interesting mechanic that this may propose is that there may be several paths
                                through tutorial or puzzle sections that the player wouldn't know how to even solve
                                yet, but going back would easily notice. An experienced player could potentially
                                bypass the tutorial all-together due to an advanced solution that a novice would miss.
                            </p></li>

                                This technique gives trust to your players without handholding and big compasses.
                                It really utilizes the intellegence of the player in a satisfying way.

                                *Be Careful - Not every Metroidvania should use this technique. If the system is not
                                carefully designed, the player could miss information, get stuck, or get frustrated.

                                Unfortunatly this feeling is hard to pin-point and usually depends on each specific
                                game. It should help a player feel like they are truly interacting with and touching
                                the game world.

                                Some pretty good examples of this in-game technique can be seen through screen shake,
                                precice time manipulation, or almost anything to give the player feedback that their
                                character is interacting with the world or enemies. Sound effects can play a big
                                part in game feel as well (<a href="#adaptive-soundtrack">Adaptive Sounds</a>)

                                be tones rising with each subsequent collection of points, or simply realistic gun
                                shot sounds rather than bland shots.

                                The camera can play a huge role in game feel too. It should have an intelligence
                                about it and move around the world in a unique manner.
                            </p></li>

                                Ultimately, game, feel is all about doubling down on the core of your gameplay
                                and perfecting those mechanics. It takes a lot of polish and tinkering to make it
                                work but the end result is much better.

                                <b>This section looks at a Japanese poem structure technique that allows players to
                                be introduced to a mechanic, develop it, twist it, and embed that mechanic in the
                                players arsenal.</b>
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                <b>Introduction</b> - In the first stage, safely introduce the mechanic to the player
                                where they would not be punished for failure.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                <b>Develop</b> - In the second stage, use the mechanic again in a harder system
                                where they may have to get better until they can pass.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                <b>Twist</b> - In the third stage, turn the concept on its head to help solidify
                                the players mastery or let them think about the concept more deeply.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                <b>Conclusion</b> - In the final stage, give the player a chance to really show off
                                their newly honed skills with a flagpole type finish. Could be a hard way to finish
                                the level, or use those skills in a boss fight.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                This technique is helpful in the long run because the game can re-introduce concepts
                                introduced earlier and be confident the player will remember and utilize the same
                                skills as they used previously.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                Be sure to let a mechanic mature so the player has adequate time to learn and perfect
                                it. Also don't throw too many mechanics at a player at once, unless they have learned
                                the previous mechanics and your just twisting the current mechanic.
                            </p></li>

                        <h2>Redesigning Death</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                <b>Death can be used as an intricate and unique component in a game that can shape
                                    a game and its core meaning.</b>
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                For many years, death has been executed in relatively the same way. Player dies.
                                Black screen. Rewind time. Try again.
                                <br>Mostly, the only thing thats changed is games are even more lenient.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                There are some solutions however. Many rogue like games will completely change when
                                the player dies. Spelunky and others change their dungeons before setting you out
                                again or have checkpoints you can access with a risk of missing crucial early items.
                                Rogue Legacy even changes the characters lineage to help get a different playstyle.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                Some even more in-depth death mechanics we can see today is Shadow of Mordor. The
                                Nemesis System changes the core enemy groups on a players death. In this case, the
                                player may get killed, but the enemy that kills the player really changes the
                                enemy group dynamic.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                When killing a player, don't take everything away from them but give them the
                                opportunity to risk winning their loot back. Some games even make you face previous
                                versions of yourself in order to take regain your pride.

                                <b>There is a hidden linear progression in many Metroidvanias and other genres that
                                    can steer a player in the correct direction without halting their curiosity
                                    and exploration.</b>
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                The Metroidvania formula is a strong design concept that has ways of going right
                                and wrong. Axiom Verge is one such game that brings back the nostolgic roots of
                                great Metroidvania games.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                One great rule that AV abides by is that it never tells you where to go, and this
                                rule can be applied to many other genres as well. While AV gives the player the
                                illusion of complete freedom, it does use some interesting tricks to help the
                                player stay on the recommended path.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                We can see this when a player comes to an important point that is visually
                                sealed in their brain, however they have no way at that point of passing. When
                                a user gets the tool needed to get through, that visual memory will easily
                                come back to the player in a AHAA! moment. Gives them something to be excited about
                                coming back to.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                Another trick AV uses is to give a player more than one option in progressing or
                                doubling down on that mechanic to help show them the possibilities. Giving a user
                                multiple options to the same result multiplies the chance that they will understand
                                and successfully use the mechanic.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                In order to reduce unecessary backtracking when in a critical puzzle solving moment
                                or important mechanic tutorial, use temporary barriers to allow the player to focus
                                on the key concept in that location. This helps users solidify their understanding
                                of a mechanic.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                Don't completely rule out backtracking however. Allow the player to explore and
                                even discover crazy new things with their awesome new powers. Powerful and experienced
                                players should be able to breeze through old parts of the game with new things to
                                discover and some incentive to do so. Backtracking should be just as fun as going
                                through the first time.

                                Many Story Telling games are hindered by their limitations to freely allow the user
                                to fully explore an open narrative. They use tricks to bring the player back on the
                                core store line, or play out a scene with just different settings or characters.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove pull-right" style="display:none;"></span>
                                However, many other games, not even in a story telling genre reveal systems that
                                tell better and more personal stories that a fixed story line could. When systems
                                can interact with each other in unique ways, it gives the player a chance to see
                                events that probably other players wouldn't.
