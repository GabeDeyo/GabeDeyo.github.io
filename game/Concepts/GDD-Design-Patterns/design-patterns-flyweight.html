    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            For this interesting pattern, imagine a sprawling forest. The trees all clearly the
            same species, but unique in their own way. This is made possible by the <b>Flyweight</b>.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            It's easy to describe and visualize a forest, however implementation can be a pain in
            the ass. We're talking thosands of trees, each with detailed geometry containing thousands
            of polygons.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Each tree has a bunch of bits associated with it.
            <br>&nbsp; &bull; A mesh of polygons that define the shape of the trunk, branches, and greenery.
            <br>&nbsp; &bull; Textures for the bark and leaves.
            <br>&nbsp; &bull; Its location and orientation in the forest.
            <br>&nbsp; &bull; Tuning parameters like size and tint so that each tree looks different.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            In code this would be:
            <pre>
            class Tree {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                private Mesh mesh_;
                private Texture bark_;
                private Texture leaves_;
                private Vector position_;
                private double height_;
                private double thickness_;
                private Color barkTint_;
                private Color leafTint_;
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            This is clearly a lot of data, especially considering the mesh and textures are large.
            Throwing thousands of these at the GPU in one frame would be disasterous. Fortunatly
            we have a pretty slick trick in dealing with this issue.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            The <b>key note</b> here is that even though the forest contains thousands of trees,
            most look at least similar. They will probably use the same mesh and textures. So
            some fields of the Tree will be the <i>same</i> between all instances. (i.e. mesh, bark, leaves)
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            We can basically split the object in half then. First we'll put all common properties
            into a seperate class.
            <pre>
                class TreeModel {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                    private Mesh mesh_;
                    private Texture bark_;
                    private Texture leaves_;
                }
            </pre>
            Since there's no reason to have the same meshes and textures in memory a thousand times.
            Then each instance of a tree should have a reference to that shared TreeModel. Then the
            Tree only contains instance-specific properties.
            <pre>
                class Tree {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                    private TreeModel* model_;
                    private Vector position_;
                    private double height_;
                    private double thickness_;
                    private Color barkTint_;
                    private Color leafTint_;
                }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Splitting the Tree up this ways is helpful for storing data in main memory, but still
            doesn't solve the issue of rendering it. We need to express this resource sharing
            in a way that the graphics card understands.
        </p></li>
    </ul>
    <a href="#title"><span class="glyphicon-menu-up"></span></a>
</div>

<div class="jumbotron col-md-12 heliList" id="thousand-instances">
    <h2>A Thousand Instances</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            To minimize the amount of data we're sending to the GPU, we need to send the shared
            data - TreeModel - just <b>once</b>. Then seperatly push over the tree's unique data.
            Finally, tell the GPU to use that one model to render each of those instances.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Luckily, both Direct3D and OpenGL can do something called <i>instance rendering</i>.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            In both API's, you provide two streams of data. The first is the blob of common
            data that will be rendered multiple times. The second is the list of instances and
            their params that will be used to vary that first chunk of data each time it's drawn.
            With a single drawcall, an entire forest sprouts.
        </p></li>
    </ul>
    <a href="#title"><span class="glyphicon-menu-up"></span></a>

<div class="jumbotron col-md-12 heliList" id="flyweight">
    <h2>Flyweight</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            This Pattern comes into play when you have objects that need to be lightweight, generally
            because you have too many of them.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            This pattern solves this issue by separating out an object's data into two kinds. The
            first kind of data is the stuff that's not specific to a single instance of that object
            and can be shared across many of them. Commonly known as the <i>intrinsic state</i>,
            but it's better understandable as "context-free" objects.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            The rest of the data is <i>extrinsic state</i> information. This is data unique to
            just that instance. This pattern saves memory by sharing one copy of the intrisic state
            across every place where an object appears.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Our previous example is pretty easy to identify where the pattern is used because we
            have a clear separate identity for the shared state: the TreeModel.
            <br>But the Flyweight Pattern can be fairly elusive when used in cases where there
            is no real well-defined identity for the shared object. Lets look at an example to
            see how that works.
        </p></li>
    </ul>

<div class="jumbotron col-md-12 heliList" id="put-down-roots">
    <h2>A Place to Put Down Roots</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            The ground we had those trees rooted in was pretty diverse as well. In fact, it has
            patches of grass, dirt, hills, lakes, rivers, and whatever else terains have. This
            would be a great place to make the ground tile-based: the surface of the world is a huge
            grid of tiny tiles. Each tile is covered in one kind of terrain.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Each terrain type has a number of properties that affect gameplay:
            <br>&nbsp; &bull; A movement cost that determines how fast a player can move through it.
            <br>&nbsp; &bull; A flag for whether it's a watery terrain that can be crossed by boats.
            <br>&nbsp; &bull; A texture to render it.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            It would not be very efficient to store all of that state data in each tile of the world.
            Instead, a common approach is to use an enum for terrain types:
            <pre>
            enum Terrain {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                TERRAIN_GRASS,
                TERRAIN_HILL,
                TERRAIN_RIVER
                // Other terrains...
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Then the world would maintain a huge grid of those: <br>
            <pre>
            class World {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                private Terrain tiles_[WIDTH][HEIGHT];
            }
            </pre>
            Note* Here we are using a nested array to store the 2D grid. That's efficient in
            C/C++ because it will pack all the elements together. In Java or other memory-managed
            languages, doing that will actually give you an array of rows where each element is a
            reference to the array of columns, which may not be as memory-friendly as you'd like.
            <br>In either case, real code would be better served by hiding this implementation detail
            behind a nice 2D grid data structure. We're doing this here just to keep it simple.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            In order to actually get useful data about a tile, we do something like:
            <pre>
            int World::getMovementCost(int x, int y) {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                switch(tiles[x][y]) {
                    case TERRAIN_GRASS: return 1;
                    case TERRAIN_HILL: return 3;
                    case TERRAIN_RIVER: return 2;
                    //Other terrains...
                }
            }

            bool World::isWater(int x, int y) {
                switch(tiles[x][y]) {
                    case TERRAIN_GRASS: return false;
                    case TERRAIN_HILL: return false;
                    case TERRAIN_RIVER: return true;
                    //Other terrains...
                }
            }
            </pre>

            I know I just spent a dick ton amount of time getting that setup, but it's ugly.
            We should be thinking of movement cost and wetness as data about the terrain, but
            here it's embedded in code. Worse, the data for a single terrain type is smeared
            across a bunch of methods. It would be nice to keep things encapsulated together.
            That is what objects are design for after all.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            It would be better if our terrain was designed like so:
            <pre>
            class Terrain {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                public Terrain(int movementCost, bool isWater, Texture texture) : movementCost_(movementCost), isWater_(isWater), texture_(texture) {}
                public int getMovementCost() const { return movementCost_; }
                public bool isWater() const { return isWater_; }
                public const Texture&amp; getTexture() const { return texture_; }
                private int movementCost_;
                private bool isWater_;
                private Texture texture_;
            }
            </pre>
            Note* all methods are const. Because the same object is used in multiple contexts,
            if you were to modify it, the changes would appear in multiple places simultaneously.
            <br>That's probably not what you want. Sharing objects to save memory should be an
            optimization that doesn't affect the visible behavior of the app. Because of this,
            Flyweight objects are almost always immutable.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Notice in the Terrain class, there is actually <i>nothing</i> specific to where
            the tile is. In flyweight terms, all of a terrain's state is "intrisic" or "context-free".
            Given that, there's no reason to have more than one of each terrain type. Every
            grass tile on the ground is identical to every other one. Instead of having the world
            be a grid of enums or Terrain objects, it will be a grid of pointers to Terrain objects.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Each tile that uses the same terrain will point to the same terrain instance:
            <pre>
            class World {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                private Terrain* tiles_[WIDTH][HEIGHT];
                //Other stuff...
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Since the terrain instances are used in multiple places, their lifetimes would be a
            little more complex to manage if you were to dynamically allocate them.
            Instead, we'll just store them directly in the world:
            <pre>
            class World {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                public World() : grassTerrain_(1, false, GRASS_TEXTURE), hillTerrain_(3, false, HILL_TERRAIN), riverTerrain_(2, true, RIVER_TERRAIN) {}
                private Terrain grassTerrain_;
                private Terrain hillTerrain_;
                private Terrain riverTerrain_;
                //Others if needed
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            And paint the ground like this:
            <pre>
            void World::generateTerrain() {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                //Fill the ground with grass.
                for(int x = 0; x < WIDTH; x++) {
                    for(int y = 0; y < HEIGHT; y++) {
                        //Sprinkle some hills.
                        if(random(10) == 0){
                            tiles_[x][y] = &amp;hillTerrain_;
                        } else {
                            tiles_[x][y] = &amp;grassTerrain_;
                        }
                    }
                }
                //Lay a river
                int x = random(WIDTH);
                for(int y = 0; y < HEIGHT; y++){
                    tiles_[x][y] = &amp;riverTerrain_;
                }
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Now instead of methods on World for accessing the terrain properties, we can expose
            the Terrain object directly:
            <pre>
                <span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>const Terrain&amp; World::getTile(int x, int y) const {
                    return *tiles_[x][y];
                }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            This way, World is no longer coupled to all sorts of details of terrains. If you
            want some property of the tile, you can get it right from that object:
            <pre>
            int cost = world.getTile(2, 3).getMovementCost();<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            </pre>
            So we're back to the pleasant API of working with real objects, and we did this
            with almost no overhead - a pointer is often no larger than an enum.

    <h2>What About Performance?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            We say there is "almost" no overhead because performance bean counters will
            rightfully want to know how this compares to using an enum. Referencing the
            terrain by pointer implies an indirect lookup. To get to some terrain data
            like the movement cost, you first have to follow the pointer in the grid to find
            the terrain object and then find the movement cost there. Chasing a pointer
            like this can cause a cache miss, which can slow things down.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            As always, the golden rule of optimization is <i>profile first</i>. Modern
            computer hardware is too complex for performance to be a game of pure reason
            anymore. In the tests for this chapter, there was no penalty for using a
            flyweight over an enum. Flyweights were actually noticeably faster. But
            that's entirely dependent on how other data is laid out in memory.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            What I am confident of is that using flyweight objects shoudn't be dismissed
            out of hand. They give you the advantages of an object-oriented style without
            the expense of tons of objects. If you find yourself creating an enum and doing
            lots of switches on it, consider this pattern instead. If you're worried about
            performance, at least profile first before changing your code to a less maintainable style.

            <a href="#">Factory Method</a>
            <br>In the tile example, we just eagerly created an instance for each terrain type
            and stored it in World. That made it easy to find and reuse the shared instances.
            In many cases, though, you won't want to create all of the flyweights up front.
            <br>If you can't predict which ones you actually need, it's better to create them on
            demand. To get the advantage of sharing, when you request one, you first see if
            you've already created an identical one. If so, you just return that instance.
            <br>This usually means that you have to encapsulate construction behind some
            interface that can first look for an existing object. Hiding a constructor like
            this is an example of the Factory Method pattern.

        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <a href="#">Object Pool</a>
            <br>In order to return a previously created flyweight, you'll have to keep track
            of the pool of ones that you've already instantiated. As the name implies, that
            means that an object pool might be a helpful place to store them.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <a href="#">State</a>
            <br>When you're using the State pattern, you often have "state" objects that
            don't have any fields specific to the machine that the state is being used in.
            The state's identity and methods are enough to be useful. In that case, you can
            apply this pattern and reuse that same state instance in multiple state machines
            at the same time without any problems.
