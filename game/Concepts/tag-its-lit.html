    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>
            Tag - It's Lit is a game based on the classic childs game Tag, which is a very simple concept. One person is "it" and all other are not. The person "it" physically runs after the others with the goal of chasing them until he/she can tag (touch) another player, at which point the tagged person is then "it" and the other person becomes tag-able. The game continues like this forever or some defined goal is reached.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>
            <h3>Modes</h3>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>Tag, It's Lit will feature multiple modes, each containing it's own goals, gameplay, setup, etc. TODO - These modes are half-baked and need design considerations.</p>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span><b>Classic</b> - The main goal of Tag is to <i>not</i> be "it", therefore, being not "it" will result in the accumulation of points, while being "it" will result in no points. When a player "tags" another player, the tagged player falls apart at that spot and respawns at the center of the map, accumulating zero points. The player who did the tagging is now tag-able and accumulates points. If a player is destroyed in any other way in this mode, they will receive a deduction in points, and be respawned to a random location on the map. The end of this mode is dictated by either a timer or a character reaching a point limit. Before the game starts, two items are chosen: (1) How many rounds will the game have? (2) How much time should each round last? OR How many points should a character need to win each round? Players will accumulate an Total Rounds Won throughout this round, and the player with the most points in this category at the end of the game win.</p>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span><b>Team Classic</b> - This mode is essentially the same as the Classic game mode, with Teams. At the beginning of the game, players can choose a "like" color, and there will be some UI that connects the character selector, and then those players will share points (shown as a bigger point UI). If a player on one team is it, they cannot tag the other person(s) on their own team, and both players won't accumulate points, however the other team will. All other aspects of the Classic mode are derived here.</p>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span><b>Zombie</b> - The main goal of this mode is to be the last one surviving at the end of the round. There will only be one person "it" at the beginning of this game, but any subsequent tags will result in the tagged player becoming "it" as well as the already tagged player. If a player is killed at any point in these rounds, they will be respawned at the center of the map as a zombie. The round is finished when either the timer for the round is up, or one single player is left. Again, the winner accumulates a Total Rounds Won point, and the player with the most of these points wins this game.</p>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>TODO: More modes</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>
            <h3>Player Abilities</h3>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>Each player will control their own character. Here are the characters abilities:
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; Run - Use the controller to move the character horizontally around the level.
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; Jump - Press A or X on the controller to jump.
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; Reach - Hold the left trigger to lean forward, arms outstreched resulting in faster movement an extended reach. Jumping and diving while reaching will result in smaller jumps and dives. The character will also have slower rotation while reaching.
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; Dive - Press the right trigger to dive forward with additional momentum. The character will leap forward in the direction that the player dictates, fall to the ground, and slide until stopped, then get up. While diving, the character cannot jump, reach, dive, or much of anything until they are upright.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>
            <h3>Game Mechanics</h3>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span><b>Starting AI</b> - This mechanic will try to enforce a fair chance of being the first person "it" in the different game modes. 
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; All players (human &amp; ai) will start in different locations at the edge of the maps. 
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; In the center, a pillar rises and spawns the beginning AI player. This characters job is to chase and tag one of the 1-4 players in the map. 
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; When it tags another player it will destroy the tagged player and itself. 
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; After tagging a player, the beginning AI does not come back, and the tagged player respawns at the center as "it". 
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; This mechanic may change depending on mode.</p>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span><b>Death</b> - Maps are laid out with traps, pits, and other deadly challenges.
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; If the character is killed in someway, they receive a deduction or penalty of some sort depending on the mode.
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; <i>Note</i> - These deaths result in a random respawn around the map and does not result in being "it". Being tagged by someone "it" does result in a center pillar respawn and does result in the character then being "it".
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; Some traps may be triggered through a connected trigger that somehow gets activated (player interaction, timer, etc.).
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; My initial thoughts for traps are these: spikes, punching bag/wrecking ball, flamethrower, shotgun.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>
            <h3>Items and Power-ups</h3>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span><i>Note</i> - All powerups are half-baked and will need design considerations and playtesting before finalization.</p>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span><i>Power-ups</i> - During the games, random power-ups will spawn throughout the level that are available to be picked up by players.</p>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span><i>Activated</i> - When a player picks up a power-up, the power-up is not activated until the player presses the activate button (Y or Triangle), at which point the ability will be granted for a period and the power-up slot for that character is emptied.</p>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span><i>Removing Power-ups</i> - A power-up can be removed from a characters slot if they die, or if they use the ability.</p>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span><i>Usability</i> - Power-ups will potentially react differently based on whether the person is "it" or not.</p>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span><b>Current Power-up Ideas:</b>
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; <b>Duplicate</b> - Activating this ability will spawn from the same location as the player, another "like" character ai. The ai will be the same color as the player, and is used to confuse the "it" character. The ai will be taggable (will die on tag), but not be respawnable. If the actual character is tagged while ai is active, ai dies.
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; <b>Teleport</b> - Activating this ability will randomly teleport the character to a different location on the map. May be useful if getting chased or in a tight spot.
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; <b>Bullet</b> - Activating this ability will allow the character to dive like a bullet. Their dive will be much faster and much farther. Use caution when near cliff-side though!</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>
            <h3>Progression and challenge</h3>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>Player level doesn't exist, so there is no player progression.</p>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>AI level will likely have to remain the same throughout the game, unless discovered it's easy to make easy/medium/hard AI levels.</p>

    <h2>Art Style</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>
            Initial Art Direction Ideas:
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; Isometric Camera View - Looking down diagonally on the map with a 45-ish degree angle. 
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; Low-Poly
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; Full Model Colors - All models will have a single bright color. Example: a character will be a full bright blue; a bridge will be all red.
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; Simple themes with a cartoony vibe.
        </p></li>

            Maps will be square maps, oriented either square-on or at a 45 degree angle, with low-poly furnishings (platforms, obstacles, rooms, etc).
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; Unless enclosed, the maps will leave a cliff at their edges on them for players to fall to their death from. 
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; Some maps may implement some sort of bar so players don't immediately fall off.
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; Maps will have a location theme (Industrial, Forest, House, etc.), and the color scheme and map furnishings will follow the theme.

            Characters will be built out of simple limb attachments. 
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; On death, these limbs all separate and fall to the ground. The limbs then sink into the ground after a few seconds, and the character respawns.
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; Characters will have quick and tight animations, but can be stopped mid-animation to enter their death state.
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; When players are spawned or teleported, the appear in a smoke effect, which is the same color as the character.
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; Any particle effect that comes from the character will appear as the same color as the character.
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; If a character is "it", there will be some visual factor that highlights this. Either through particle effect, lighting, or some other way.

        <li><p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>
            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>The overall theme music of the game should be lively and slightly goofy. A happy theme.</p>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>There will be around 3-5 main songs played throughout the games.
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; They should all have the same instrumentals and same lively feeling for consistency.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>
            <h3>Sounds/FX</h3>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>Player movement sounds will be cartoony and pretty subtle, as to not drowned out other more important sounds.
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; Running sounds like little pitter-patters.
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; Jumping and diving make a stronger pitter-patter noise with a slight humph from the player.
                <br> &nbsp; &bull; Player destruction sounds like bowling pins getting knocked over.</p>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>Levels will come custom with theme FX.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>
            <h3>Extra</h3>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>I would like the songs played during the levels to follow the theme of the level. So different versions or additions will be added to songs to help them reflect the theme of the level better.</p>

    <h2>Other Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>
            The main mechanics of this game are fairly simple. This means that gameplay needs to feel very good. I want players to be able to enter <b>flow</b> very easily.
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>Smooth and responsive gameplay is critical.</p>
            <p><span class='glyphicon-remove'></span>Controlling a player needs to be easy and comfortable.</p>
