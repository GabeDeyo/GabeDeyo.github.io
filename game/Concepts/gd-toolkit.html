                can do that don't directly effect gameplay such as veiwing a map or taking a picture. Any puzzle in the game can be solved with just a combination and knowledge of these two core moves.

                An experienced player could potentially bypass the tutorial all-together due to an advanced solution that a novice would miss.

            When analyzing two games from the same series, Far Cry 2 and 4, we can't help but
            notice that these feel like two completely different games. One of the core differences
            between these games is their mechanics. In 2, weapons and cars break down easily leaving
            the player vulnerable and weak in frequent intervals. In 4, many weaknesses are taken
            away and the player is left to roam the lands as a powerful player.

            there are rarely safe places to save and are sparce enough that the player needs to
            play conservativley and with a focus on survival. If you're not careful, you can lose
            tons of time if you die between a save point in FarCry 2.
            <br>Compared to FarCry 4, there is a much more lenient saving system where there is
            almost no punishmet for death at all.

        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            The guns in each game are approached quite differently as well. The player is given
            a massive variety of guns in FarCry 4 and given silenced weapons from pretty much the start.
            Weapons in FarCry 2 have the ability to degrade and get worse over time. They can also
            jam at the worst times and there aren't a ton of options here. Not to mention the only silenced
            weapon in the game is a dart gun which is the most degradable weapons in the game and only
            holds a handful of darts.

    <h2>Invisible Tutorial</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <b>Big Idea</b>
            <br>Through clever level design and building complexity, a player can be intruduced
            cleverly to any sort of mechanic in a game without losing the immersion.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Through out history, games have been shoving tutorial screen in front of it's players
            faces without remorse. A game like Dead Space more or less ruins it's own immersion
            when it tells the players how to fight the enemies 3 times, then simply displays the
            same rule in a pop-up! We analyze Half-Life 2 to see where genious tutorials are applied.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            First thing to note is that there are pretty much no pop-ups and no real instructions
            on how to play the game.
            <br>When first engaging one mechanic, the game allows you to visualize
            or experience it safely, blocks your progress with a situation where you need to use
            it, and then gives you the opportunity to learn and use it safely. In this order.
            <br>Then we see the same concept being used when introducing enemies or obstacles.
            It is seperated from the player so they are not in immediate danger, shows the
            enemy/obstacle mechanic in action, and then lets the player confront it in a simple
            confrontation.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            One important aspect of these tutorials are that they are all continuous and engaging
            parts of the story. They never take the player out of the immersion and are presented
            in clean encapsulated sections.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            It is also important to note that many of these mechanics are also presented to the
            player through level design and layers. When first getting introduced to a puzzle
            mechanic, there are always hints in the game world to help guide the player towards
            the solution. Then after getting familiar with that core principle, the game starts
            adding layers of complexity onto that puzzle, although, one layer by one and never
            overloading them with mechanics.

        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span> Another trick AV uses is to give a player more than one option in progressing or doubling down on that mechanic to help show them the possibilities.

        <li>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span> In order to reduce unecessary backtracking when in a critical puzzle solving moment or important mechanic tutorial, use temporary barriers

            <b>Big Idea</b>
            <br>By secretly implementing a dynamic difficulty system, a designer can inflict
            the sweet spot of flow in their players and make the experience feel perfectly suited
            to each players skill level.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            After analyzing Capcoms Resident Evil 4, lets look at some mechanics that actually
            change when the player is not doing too well.
            <br>&nbsp; &bull; Enemies don't rush as quick.
            <br>&nbsp; &bull; More loot found in crates and more frequent.
            <br>&nbsp; &bull; Enemies are easier to take down.
            <br>&nbsp; &bull; Some enemies won't even show up.
            <br>There are others, but each independently changed based on player skill.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Easily the biggest advantages to a dynamic difficulty system is setting the player
            into <b>flow</b>. In this state, the player experiences the game with enough difficulty
            where it's not too boring and easy, and not too frustrating and hard.
            <br>When other games force the player to select a difficulty at the beginning of
            the game or change it manually, the player may not experience the game in the intended way.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            So while the dynamic difficulty can allow the player to progress while being properly
            challenged, it's still not the best advantage of the system. The game NEVER tells you
            that there is even a mechanic in place for that use. Many games do however and some
            even mock or cheat a player through when they don't play well. Resident Evil 4 never
            gives the sense that a player is doing bad and never cheats them out of that rewarding
            progress.

            When analyzing the Batman Arkham games, there is an arguable winner. Arkham Asylum
            is almost always the popular choice among critics even though it's size and scale
            pale in comparison to its predecessors. The map is smaller, there are less characters,
            less mechanics, and really just smaller in general. So why do people prefer this game
            over the bigger, bulkier others?
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            The first thing to notice is that the mechanics and combat don't actually benefit
            from being set in a larger game space. In fact, they seem to work much better in
            the purpose built levels of Arkham than the open world of the others.

        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            When considering a sandbox, it should make sense to only put sandbox elements in
            that world, otherwise those elements can get lost in the vastness. Then it will
            feel like the game only truly takes place in these specific sections and lifeless
            between.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            One of the biggest victims of a large game world is story. Narrative can get completely
            lost when the world offers too many distractions. In these games, the narrative is
            too often interupted by side-quests and small things to do.
            <br>Arkham Asylum was great because the story was able to be paced evenly and there
            was still great gameplay to follow it up even if there was less features.
            A key principle in game design is quality over quantity. Work out extremely well polished
            mechanics rather than a plethora of okay mechanics.

            perfect heist game.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            The Swindle creates amazing tension within the player by setting the stakes very high.
            A slip up in this game could cost you in the end, and yet the game pushes and lures
            the player toward risky situations in order to get that sweet sweet loot.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            The Swindle only provides a limited amount of mechanics which you can use to progress
            through the games heists. Getting loot allows you to upgrade those mechanics, unlock
            more heists, and gain access to the last heist, "The Swindle". But it's perfection
            comes from two design features.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            1. There is only 100 days (heists) that you get to complete "The Swindle". If you don't
            make it, thats game over.
            <br>2. Also the character recieves certain bonuses based on how their performance for
            each heist went.

            <b>Rule 1. </b>Provide clear goals. Players should always know what their long and

        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <b>Rule 2. </b>Sign posting. Posting clear sign posting is a great way to subtly
            guiding the player. The technique doesn't have to be include literal signs, but clever
            clues to the goal. Carefully design the signs so they don't feel to easy or hard.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <b>Rule 3. </b>Feedback. A puzzle should help solve itself. Nudging a player
            towards the goal can be less infiriating.

    <h2>Lessons from a Real Time Turnbase</h2>

            <b>Embracing strong features, whether designed or not, can result it unique and amibitious

        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <b>Lesson 1. </b>Even the most diseparate genres of games can come together.
            <br>We can see this done well in Nova 111 where real-time actions and turn-based
            actions can be used together in a strategic manner. Many environmental object react
            to the players actions in real time and behave like they would normally, where enemies
            can only act in turn based style which is completely based on user interaction.
            <br>A strategic way to use this mechanic is by dropping a stalagtite from the cieling,
            and luring an enemy into it's path by progressing the turn quickly. This can also make
            gameplay tricky for the player when they are put in a tight position and need to act quickly.
            <br>Its a great push and pull between real-time actions and turn based strategy.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <b>Lesson 2.</b>Be serendipitous towards interesting developmnets of game development.
            <br>Several game changing features were discovered through errors or glitches in the
            development cycle. If the feature makes sense or can be built upon, embrace it.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <b>Lesson 3.</b>If some feature is at the core of your game, it needs to shine through

            <b>The way a user controls a character and the way a character moves/behaves should

        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Movement should not be a declining automated process where the user doesn't even need
            to think about it. It should be a thoughtfull and skillful mechanic which rewards the player
            for correctly managing it's system.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            A player should feel as though they are behaving like the character, not just controlling the
            character. Character response should be fluid and instantaneous. There shouldn't be any
            disconnect between how the user interacts with a character, and how the character behaves.

    <h2>How "Her Story" Works</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <b>There is a artful design aspect where players are carefully guided through
            a complicated narrative and making it feel like a completely open story.</b>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Her Story is presented as a non-linear narrative story that makes the player feel like they
            are unravelling the story piece by piece. However, behind the scenes, this game uses clever
            techniques to keep the player on a linear track.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            The designer is always aware however, of the location in the narrative story where the
            player is. And is always prepared to halt the player from skipping the entire story when
            necessary.
            <br>In some locations, the player is actually rewarded for being clever, and can skip small
            portions where less clever players would be progressing slowly. An important part of this
            game is not solving the end story, but actually understanding the story fully.

    <h2>How Jonathan Blow Designs Puzzles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <b>For Jonathan Blow, a puzzle is never a puzzle. It's a way for a player and designer
            to communicate understanding between the two.</b>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            For his first game, Braid, Jon started with a <b>Mechanic</b>. In this case it was the ability
            to rewind time for a nearly unlimited amount of time.
            <br>Then he add a <b>Rule</b> which slightly changed the main mechanic of the game. The first
            rule we encounter is that some select object won't be effected by the rewind effect. This leads
            to some interesting and clever puzzles.
            <br>Nearly every level after this first rule's introduction, is some variation of manipulating
            that main mechanic.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            In his second game, The Witness, he explores the same development psyche. Blow establishes a
            main mechanic and builds upon that with rules through exploration and testing.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            One of the most brilliant features of his design is that the rules fully utilize the full potential
            of their uniqness. If there is a strange consequence of the rule, there is surely a puzzle
            based on this consequence. He also cleverly guides you to try out solutions again with misdirection,
            only to show you that it is incorrect and you should try something else.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            He gives the players a way to fully explore and understand the core system of a rule or mechanic
            before letting you continue. Then implements those base concepts in later levels twisted by
            those levels new rule.

    <h2>Spelunky Puzzles</h2>
    <ul>

            <b>Spelunky proves that random and authored content doesn't have to lead to
            soulless levels. And learning underlying mechanics can make random levels interesting
        to play.</b>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Spelunky's designer has found the perfect balance between Random and Authored content.
            To understand how these levels are created, we're going to walk through the process
            from head to toe to get an idea.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            The design of a leve starts out with 16 rooms in a 4x4 grid. It randomly picks a
            room in the top row to be the entrance. From the entrance, a path is selected to the left,
            right, or bottom of that room and repeated until we get to the lowest level. If the
            path tries to go down when on the bottom row, an exit is created.
            <br>It's important to note that this dedicated path will always allow a player to move
            through it without needing any other tools. Anything room not on the path is not
            garunteed to be a viable path.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            After the level path is created, each room is given a random template. Some of these
            templates are fully crafted by the designer and usually signify a common room in the levels,
            where other rooms are fully crafted using random placment of blocks.
            <br>Once rooms are finished, a dice is rolled to place enemies, items, and gems around the rooms.
            This isn't completely random because we want some things to spawn more than other at specific
            locations and differently later on.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            With fixed and random content, any levels design will have enough variation and difference
            between the last, that the player can't get accustomed to it's tricks. The designer also
            gives players a risk vs reward system that allows players to risk their safety to get
            a usually helpful reward. But it's also a guessing game to find out whether or not that
            reward will be worth any of the risk.
