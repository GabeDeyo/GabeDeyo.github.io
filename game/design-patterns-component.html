        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Let's say we're building a platformer. The Italian plumber demographic is covered, so ours will star a Danish baker, Bjorn. It stands to reason that we'll have a class representing our friendly pastry chef, and it will contain everything he does in the game.
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Since the player controls him,that means reading controller input and translating that input into motion. And, of corse, he needs to interact with the level, so some physics and collision go in there. Once that's done, he's got to show up on screen, so toss in animation and rendering. He'll probably play some sounds too.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Hold on a minute; this is getting out of control. Software Architecture 101 tells us that different domains in a program should be kept isolated from each other. If we're making a word processor, the code that handles printing shouldn't be affected by the code that loads and saves documents. A game doesn't have the same domain as a business app, but the rule still applies.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>As much as possible, we don't want AI, physics, rendering, sound and other domains to know about each other, but now we've got all that crammed into one class. We've seen where this road leads to: a 5,000-line dumping ground source file so big that only the bravest ninja coders on your team even dare to go in there.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Thisis great job security for the few who can tame it, but it's hell for the rest of us. A class that big means even the most seemingly trivial changes can have far-reaching implications. Soo, the class collects <i>bugs</i> faster than it collects <i>features</i>.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>The Gordion Knot</h3>
            <p>Even worse than the simple scale problem is the coupling one. All of the different systems in our game have been tied into a giant knotted ball of code like:</p>
            <pre>
            <span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>if(collidingWithFloor() &amp;&amp; (getRenderState() != INVISIBLE)) {
                playSound(HIT_FLOOR);
            }
            </pre>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Any programmer trying to make a change in code like that will need to know something about physics, graphics, and sound just to make sure they don't break anything.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>These two problems compound each other; the class touches so many domains that every programmer will have to work on it, but it's so huge that doing so is a nightmare. If it gets bad enough, coders will start putting hacks in other parts of the codebase just to stay out of the hairball that this Bjorn class has become.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Culling the Knot</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>We can solve this like Alexander the Great - with a sword. We'll take our monolithic Bjorn class and slice it into separate parts along domain boundaries. For example, we'll take all of the code for handling user input and move it into a separate InputComponent class. Bjorn will then own an instance of this component. We'll repeat this process for each of the domains that Bjorntouches.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>When we're done, we'll have moved almost everything out of bjorn. All that remains is a thing shell that binds the components together. We've solved our huge class problem by simply divinding it up into multiple smaller classes, but we've accomplished more than just that.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            <h3>Loose Ends</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Our component classes are now decoupled. Even though Bjorn has a PhysicsComponent and a GraphicsComponent, the two don't know about each other. This means the person working on physics can modify their component without needing to know anything about graphics and vice versa.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>In practice, the components will need to have <i>some</i> interaction between themselves. For example, the AI component may need to tell the physics component where BJorn is trying to go. However, we can restrict this to the components that <i>do</i> need to talk instead of just tossing them all in the same playpen together.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Tying Back Together</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Another feature of this design is that the components are now reusable packages. So far, we've focused on our backer, but let's consider a couple of other kinds of objects in our game world. <i>Decorations</i> are things in the world the player sees but doesn't interact with: bushes, debris and other visual detail. <i>Propbs</i> are like decorations but can be touched: boxes, boulders, and trees. <i>Zones</i> are the opposite of decorations - invisible but interactive. They're useful for things like triggering a cutscene when Bjorn enters an area.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Now, consider how we'd set up an inheritance hierarchy for those classes if we weren't using components. A first passable idea might be:</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Zone(Collision..)/Decoration(Rendering..) -> GameObject &amp;&amp; Prop(Rendering..) -> Zone(Collision)</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>We have a base GameObject class that has common stuff like position and orientation. Zone inherits from that and adds collision detection. Likewise, Decoration inherits from GameObejct and adds rendering. Prop inherits from zone, so it can reuse the collision code. However, Prop can't <i>also</i> inherit from Decoration to reuse the <i>rendering</i> code without running into the Deadly Diamon.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>The "Deadly Diamond" occurs in class hierarchies with multiple inheritance where there are two different paths to the same base class. The pain that causes is a bit out of scope for this task, but understand that they named it "deadly" for a reason.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>We could flip things around so that Prop inherits form Decoration, but then we end up having to duplicate the collision code. Either way, there's no clean way to reuse the collision and rendering code between the classes that need it without resorting to multiple inheritance. The only other option is to push everything up to GameObject, but then Zone is wasting memory on rendering data it doesn't need and Decoration is doing the same with physics.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Now, let's try it with components. Our subclasses disappear completely. Instead, we have a single GameObject class and two component classes: PhysicsComponent and GraphicsComponent. A decoration is simply a GameObejct with a GraphicsComponent but no Physics component. A zone is the opposite, and a prop has both components. No code duplication, no multiple inheritance, and only three classes instead of four.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Components are basically plug-and-play for objects. They let us build complex entities with rich behavior by plugging different reusable component objects into sockets on the entity. Think software Voltron.</p>

            Components are most commonly found within the core class that defines the entities in a game, but they may be useful in other places as well. This pattern can be put to good use when any of these are true:
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            &bull; You have a class that touches multiple domains which you want to keep decoupled from each other.
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span> &bull; A class is getting massive and hard to work with.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span> &bull; You want to be able to define a variety of objects that share different capabilities, but using inheritance doesn't let you pick the parts you want to reuse precisely enough.</p>
        </p></li>
    </ul>
    <a href="#title"><span class="glyphicon-menu-up"></span></a>
</div>

    <h2>Keep In Mind</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            The Component pattern adds a good bit of complexity over simply making a class and putting code in it. Each conceptual "object" becomes a cluster of objects that must be initiated, initialized, and correctly wired together. Communicating between the different components becomes more challenging, and controlling how they occupy memory is more complex.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            For a large codebase, this complexity may be worth it for the decoupling and code reuse it enables, but take care to ensure you aren't over-engineering a "solution" to a non-existent problem before applying this pattern.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Another consequence of using components is that you often have to hop through a level of indirection to get anything done. Given the container object, first you have to get the component you want, <i>then</i> you can do what you need. In performance-critical inner loops, this pointer following may lead to poor performance.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            There's a flip side to this coin. The Component pattern can often <i>improve</i> performance and cache coherence. Components make it easier to use the <a href="design-patterns-data-locality.html">Data Locality</a> pattern to organize your data in the order that the CPU wants it.

            One of the biggest challenges for me in writing these notes is figuring out how to isolate each pattern. Many design patterns exist to contain code that itself isn't part of each pattern. In order to distill the pattern down to its essence, I try to cut as much of that out as possible, but at some point it becomes a bit like explaining how to organize a closet without showing any clothes.
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>The Component pattern is a particularly hard one. You can't get a real feel for it without seeing some code for each of the domains that it decouples, so I'll have to sketch this out a bit more in Bjorn's code. The pattern is really only the component <i>classes</i> themselves, but the code in them should help clarify what the classes are for. It's fake code - it calls into other classes that aren't presented here - but it should give you an idea of what we're going for.</p>

            <h3>A Monolithic Class</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>To get a clearer picture of how this pattern is applied, we'll start by showing a monolithic Bjorn class that does everything we need but doesn't use this pattern:</p>
            <pre>
            <span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>class Bjorn{
                public Bjorn() : velocity_(0), x_(0), y_(0) {}

                public void update(World&amp; world, Graphics&amp; graphics);

                private static const int WALK_ACCELERATION = 1;

                private int velocity_;
                private int x_, y_;

                private Volume volume_;
                
                private Sprite spriteStand_;
                private Sprite spriteWalkLeft_;
                private Sprite spriteWalkRight_;
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Bjorn has an update() method that gets called once per frame by the game:
            <pre>
            <span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>void Bjorn::update(World&amp; world, Graphics&amp; graphics) {
                //Apply user input to hero's velocity.
                switch(Controller::getJoystickDirection()) {
                    case DIR_LEFT:
                        velocity_ -= WALK_ACCELERATION;
                        break;
                    case DIR_RIGHT:
                        velocity_ += WALK_ACCELERATION;
                        break;
                }

                //Modify position by velocity
                x_ += velocity_;
                world.resolveCollision(volume_, x_, y_, velocity_);

                //Draw the appropriate sprite.
                Sprite* sprite = &amp;spriteStand_;
                if(velocity_ < 0){
                    sprite = &amp;spriteWalkLeft_;
                } else if(velocity_ > 0) {
                    sprite = &amp;spriteWalkRight_;
                }

                graphics.draw(*sprite, x_, y_);
            }

            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>It reads the input to determine how to accelerate the baker. Then it resolves its new position with the physics engine. Finally it draw Bjorn onto the screen.</p>

            The sample implementation here is trivially simple. There's no gravity, animation, or any of the dozens of other details that make a character fun to play. Even so, we can see that we've got a single function that several different coders on our team will probably have to spend time in, and it's starting to get a bit messy. Imagine this scaled up to a thousand lines and you can get an idea how painful it can become.

            <h3>Splitting out a domain</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Starting with one domain, let's pull a piece out of Bjorn and push it into a separate component class. We'll start with the first domain that gets processed: input. The first thing Bjorn does is read a user input and adjust his velocity based on that input. Let's move that logic out into a separate class:</p>
            <pre>
            <span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>class InputComponent {
                public void update(Bjorn&amp; bjorn) {
                    switch(Controller::getJoystickDirection()){
                        case DIR_LEFT:
                            bjorn.veloctiy -= WALK_ACCELERATION;
                            break;
                        case DIR_RIGHT:
                            bjorn.velocity += WALK_ACCELERATION;
                            break;
                    }
                }

                private static const int WALK_ACCELERATION = 1;
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Pretty simple. We've taken the first section of Bjorn's update() method and put it into this class. The changes to Bjorn are also straightforward:
            <pre>
            <span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>class Bjorn {
                public int velocity;
                public int x, y;

                public void update(World&amp; world, Graphics&amp; graphics) {
                    input_.update(*this);

                    //Modify position based by velocity
                    x += velocity;
                    world.resolveCollision(volume_, x, y, velocity);

                    //Draw the appropriate sprite
                    Sprite* sprite = &amp;spriteStand_;
                    if(velocity < 0){
                        sprite = &amp;spriteWalkLeft_;
                    } else if(velocity > 0){
                        sprite = &amp;spriteWalkRight_;
                    }

                    graphics.draw(*sprite, x, y);
                }

                private InputComponent input_;

                private Volume volume_;

                private Sprite spriteStand_;
                private Sprite spriteWalkLeft_;
                private Sprite spriteWalkRight_;
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Bjorn now owns an InputComponent object. Where before he was handling user input directly in the update() method, now he delegates to the component:
            <pre><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>input_.update(*this);</pre>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>We've only started, but already we've gotten rid of some coupling - the main Bjorn class no longer has any reference to Controller. This will come in handy later.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Splitting out the rest</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Now, let's go ahead and do the same cut-and-paste job on the physics and graphics code. Here's our new PhysicsComponent:</p>
            <pre>
            <span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>class PhysicsComponent {
                public void update(Bjorn&amp; bjorn, World&amp; world) {
                    bjorn.x += bjorn.velocity;
                    world.resolveCollision(volume_, bjorn.x, bjorn.y, bjorn.velocity);
                }

                private Volume volume_;
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            In addition to moving the physics behavior out of the main Bjorn class, you can see we've also moved out the data too: The Volume object is now owned by the component.
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Last but not least, here's where the rendering code lives now:</p>
            <pre>
            <span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>class GraphicsComponent {
                public void update(Bjorn&amp; bjorn, Graphics&amp; graphics) {
                    Sprite* sprite = &spriteStand_;
                    if(bjorn.velocity < 0) {
                        sprite = &amp;spriteWalkLeft_;
                    } else if(bjorn.velocity > 0) {
                        sprite = &amp;spriteWalkRight_;
                    }

                    graphics.draw(*sprite, bjorn.x, bjorn.y);
                }

                private Sprite spriteStand_;
                private Sprite spriteWalkLeft_;
                private Sprite spriteWalkRight_;
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            We've yanked almost everything out, so what's left of our humble pastry chef? Not much:
            <pre>
            <span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>class Bjorn {
                public int velocity;
                public int x, y;

                public void update(World&amp; world, Graphics& graphics) {
                    input_.update(*this);
                    physics_.update(*this, world);
                    grpahics_.update(*this, graphics);
                }

                private InputComponent input_;
                private PhysicsComponent physics_;
                private GraphicsComponent graphics_;
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            The Bjorn class now basically does two things: it hold the set of components that actually define it, and it holds the state that is shared across multiple domains. Position and velocity are still in the core Bjorn class for two reasons. First, they are "pan-domain" state - almost every component will make use of them, so it isn't clear which component <i>should</i> own them if we did not want to push them down. Secondly, and more importantly, it gives us an easy way for the components to communicate without being coupled to each other. Let's see if we can put that to use.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Robo-Bjorn</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>So far, we've pushed our behavior out to separate component classes, but we haven't <i>abstracted</i> the behavior out. Bjorn still knows the exact concrete classes where his behavior is defined. Let's change that.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>We'll take our component for handling user input and hide it behind an interface. We'll turn InputComponent into an abstract class:</p>
            <pre>
            <span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>class InputComponent {
                public virtual ~InputComponent() {}
                public virtual void update(Bjorn&amp; bjorn) = 0;
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Then, we'll take our existing user input handling code and push it down into a class that implements that interface:
            <pre>
            <span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>class PlayerInputComponent : public InputComponent {
                public virtual void update(Bjorn&amp; bjorn) {
                    switch(Controller::getJoystickDirection()) {
                        case DIR_LEFT:
                            bjorn.velocity -= WALK_ACCELERATION;
                            break;
                        case DIR_RIGHT:
                            bjorn.velocity += WALK_ACCELERATION;
                            break;
                    }
                }

                private static const int WALK_ACCELERATION = 1;
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            We'll change Bjorn to hold a pointer to the input component instead of having an inline instance:
            <pre>
            <span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>class Bjorn {
                public int velocity;
                public int x, y;

                public Bjorn(InputComponent* input) : input_(input) {}

                public void update(World&amp; world, Graphics&amp; graphics) {
                    input_->update(*this);
                    physics_.update(*this, world);
                    graphics_.update(*this, graphics);
                }

                private InputComponent* input_;
                private PhysicsComponent physics_;
                private GraphicsComponent graphics_;
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Now, when we instantiate Bjorn, we can pass in an input component for it to use, like so:
            <pre>
            Bjorn* bjorn = new Bjorn(new PlayerInputComponent());
            </pre>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>This instance can be any concrete type that implements our abstract InputComponent interface. We pay a price for this - update() is now a virtual method call, which is a little slower. What do we get in return for this cost?</p>
