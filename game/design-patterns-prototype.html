            Imagine our game has enemies swarming the hero, entering by way of "spawners", with a
            different spawner for each type of enemy.
            <br>For this example, lets say we have classes for each type of enemy in the game:
            <pre>
            class Monster {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                //Monster stuff
            }

            class Ghost : public Monster {};
            class Demon : public Monster {};
            class Sorcerer : public Monster {};
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            A spawner constructs instances of one particular monster type. To support every monster
            in the game, we could brute-force it by having a spawner class for each moster class,
            leading to a parallel class hierarchy:
            <br>Ghost/Demon/Sorcerer ->(inherit from) Monster ... GhostSpawner/DemonSpawner/SorcererSpawner -> Spawner
            <br>Implementing would look like this:
            <pre>
            class Spawner {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                public virtual ~Spawner() {}
                public virtual Monster* spawnMonster() = 0;
            }

            class GhostSpawner : public Spawner {
                public virtual Monster* spawnMonster() { return new Ghost(); }
            }

            class DemonSpawner : public Spawner() {
                public virtual Monster* spawnMonster() { return new Demon(); }
            }

            //And so on.
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            This will clearly result in many classes, lots of boilerplate, redundancy, lots of duplication...
            <br>The <b>Prototype</b> pattern offers a solution. They key idea is that an object can spawn
            other objects similar to itself. If you have one ghost, you can make more ghosts from it.
            If you have a demon, you can make other demons. Any monster here can be treated as a
            prototypal monster used to generate other versions of itself.

<div class="jumbotron col-md-12 heliList" id="prototype-implementation">
    <h2>Prototype Implementation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            To implement this pattern, we're going to give our base class, Monster, an abstract
            clone() method:
            <pre>
            class Monster {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                public virtual ~Monster() {}
                public virtual Monster* clone() = 0;
                //Other Stuff
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Each monster subclass provides an implementation that returns a new object identical
            in class and state to it. For example:
            <pre>
            class Ghost : public Monster {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                public Ghost(int health, int speed) : health_(health), speed_(speed) {}

                public virtual Monster* clone() {
                    return new Ghost(health_, speed_);
                }

                private int health_;
                private int speed_;
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Once all our monsters support that, we no longer need a spawner class for each
            monster class. Instead we define a single one:
            <pre>
            class Spawner {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                public Spawner(Monster* prototype) : prototype_(prototype) {}
                public Monster* spawnMonster() { return prototype_clone(); }
                private Monster* prototype_;
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            This internally holds a monster, a hidden one whose sole purpose is to be used
            by the spawner as a template to stamp out more monsters like it, sort of like
            a queen bee who never leaves the hive. <br>
            [Spawner(Monster)<-"Prototype"] -> clone() -> Monster.. Monster.. Monster..
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            To create a ghost spawner, we create a prototypal ghost instance and then
            create a spawner holding that prototype:
            <pre>
            Monster* ghostPrototype = new Ghost(15, 3);<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Spawner* ghostSpawner = new Spawner(ghostPrototype);
            </pre>
            <br>One great part about this pattern is that it doesn't just clone the class
            of the prototype, it clones its state too. This means we could make a spawner for
            fast ghost, weak ghosts, or slow ghosts just by creating an appropriate prototype ghost.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <b>How Well Does It Work?</b><br>
            So we don't have to create a separate spawner class for each monster. However,
            we do have to implement clone() in each monster class. That's about as much code
            as the spawners.
            <br>There are also some nasty semantic ratholes when you write a correct clone().
            Does it do a deep clone or shallow?
            <br>Also, not only does this not look like it's saving us much code in this
            contrived problem, there's the fact that it's a contrived problem. We had to take
            as a given that we have separate classes for each monster. These days, that's definitely
            not the way most game engines roll.
            <br>Most of us learned the hard way that big hierarchies like this are a pain to manage,
            which is why we instead use patterns like <b>Componenet</b> and <b>Type Object</b>
            to model different kinds of entities without enshrining each in its own class.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <b>Spawn Functions</b><br>
            Even if we do have different classes for each monster, there are other ways to strip it down.
            Instead of making separate spawner classes for each monster, we could make spawn functions, like so:
            <pre>
            Monster* spawnGhost() {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                return new Ghost();
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            This is less boilerplate than rolling a whole class for constructing a monster
            of some type. Then the one spawner class can simply store a function pointer:
            <pre>
            typedef Monster* (*SpawnCallback)();<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            class Spawner {
                public Spawner(SpawnCallback spawn) : spawn_(spawn) {}
                public Monster* spawnMonster() { return spawn_() }
                private SpawnCallback spawn_;
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Finally, to create a spawner for ghosts, you do:
            <pre>
            Spawner* ghostSpawner = new Spawner(spawnGhost);<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <b>Templates</b><br>
            Our spawner class needs to construct instances of some type, but we don't want to hard
            code some specific monster class. The natural solution then is to make it a <i>type
            parameter</i>, which <b>templates</b> let us do:
            <pre>
            class Spawner {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                public virtual ~Spawner(){}
                public virtual Monster* spawnMonster() = 0;
            }

            template &lt;class T&gt;
            class SpawnerFor : public Spawner {
                public virtual Monster* spawnMonster() { return new T(); }
            }

            //Using it looks like:
            Spawner* ghostSpawner = new SpawnerFor&lt;Ghost&gt;();
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Templates are a popular tool in languages nowadays. The Spawner class here is so that
            code that doesn't care what kind of monster a spawner creates can just use it and
            work with pointers to Monster.
            <br>If we only had the SpawnerFor&lt;T&gt; class, there would be no single supertype
            the instantiations of that template all shared, so any code that worked with spawners of
            any monster type would itself need to take a template parameter.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <b>First-Class Types</b><br>
            The previous two solutions address the need to have a class, Spawner, which is
            parameterized by a type. In C++, types aren't generally first-class, so that requires
            some gymnastics. If you're using a dynamically-typed language like JS, Python, or Ruby
            where classes are regular object you can pass around, you can solve this more directly.
            <br>In some ways, the <b>Type Object</b> pattern is another workaround for the lack of
            first-class types. That pattern can still be useful even in languages with them, though
            because it lets you define what a "type" is. You may want different semantics
            than what the language's built-in classes provide.
            <br>When you make a spawner, just pass in the class of monster that it should construct.
            The actual runtime object that represents the monster's class.
            <br>With all of these options, we still can't say we've found a case where the Prototype
            pattern was the best answer. Until we go deeper and explore the prototype as a
            language paradigm.

            Many people take "OOP" as synonymous with "classes". Definitions of OOP tend to feel
            like credos of opposing religious denominations, but a fairly non-contentious take
            on it is that OOP <i>let you define</i> "objects" which bundle data and code together.
            Compared to structured languages like C and functional languages like Scheme, the
            defining characteristic of OOP is that it tightly binds state and behavior together.
            <br>You may think classes are the one and only way to do that, but a handful of
            programmers beg to differ. Some of those guys created a language called <i>Self</i>
            and while as OOP as can be, it has no classes.

            In a pure sense, Self is even more object-oriented than a class-based language. We
            think of OOP as marrying state and behavior, but languages with classes actually
            have a line of seperation between them.
            <br>Consider the semantics of your favorite class-based language. To access some state
            on an object, you look in the memory of the instance itself. State is contained in
            the instance.
            <br>To invoke a method, though youlook up the instance's class, and then you look
            up the method there. Behavior is contained in the class. There's always that level
            of indirection to get to a method, which means fields and methods are different.
            <br>Ex. To invoke a virtual method in C++, you look in the instance for the pointer
            to its vtable, then look up the method.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Self eliminates that distinction. To look up anything, you just look on the object.
            An instance can contain both state and behavior. You can have a single object
            that has a method completely unique to it.
            <br>If that was all Self did, it would be hard to use. Inheritance in class-based
            languages, despite its faults, give you a useful mechanism for reusing polymorphic
            code and avoiding duplication. to accomplish something similar without class,
            Self has delegation.
            <br>To find a field or call a method on some object, we first look in the object
            itself. If it has it, we're done. If it doesn't, we look at the object's parent.
            This is just a reference to some other object. When we fail to find a property
            on the first object, we try its parent, and its parent, and so on. In other words,
            failed lookups are delegated to an object's parent.
            <br>Self actually supports multiple parents. Parents are just specially marked
            fields, which means you can do things like inherit parents or change them at
            runtime, leading to what's called dynamic inheritance.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Parent objects let us reuse behavior(and state) across multiple objects, so we've
            covered part of the utility of classes. The other key thing classes do is give us a
            way to create instances. When you need a new thingy, you can just do new Thingy().
            A class is a factory for instances of itself.
            <br>Whitout classes, how do we make new things? In particular, how do we make a
            bunch of new things that all have stuff in common? Just like the design pattern,
            the way you do this in Self is by cloning.
            <br>In self, it's as if every object supports the Prototype design pattern automatically.
            Any object can be cloned. To make a bunch of similar object, you:
            <br>&nbsp; 1. Beat one object into the shape you want. You can just clone the base
            Object built into the system and then stuff fields and methods into it.
            <br>&nbsp; 2. Clone it to make as many clones as you want.
            <br>This gives us the elegance of the Prototype design pattern without the tedium
            of having to implement clone() ourselves; it's built into the system.

    <h2>Prototypes for Data Modeling</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Lets look at an area where prototypes, specifically delegation, can be useful.
            <br>If you were to count all the bytes in a games that are code compared to
            the ones that are data, ou'd see the fraction of data has been increasing steadily
            since the dawn of programming. Early games procedurally generated almost everything
            so they could fit on floppies and old game storages. In many games today, the code is just
            an "engine" that drives the game, which is defined entirely in data.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            That's fine, but pushing piles of content into data files doesn't magically solve
            the oragnizational challenges of a large project. If anything it makes it harder.
            The reason we use programming languages is because they have tools for managing complexity.
            <br>Instead of copying and pasting a chunk of code in ten places, we move it into
            a function that we can call by name. Instead of copying a method in a bunch of classes,
            we can put it in a seperate class that those classes inherit from or mix in.
            <br>When the game's data reaches a certain size, you really start wanting similar
            features. Data modeling is a deep subject that I can't hope to do justice here,
            but I do want to throw out one feature for you to consider in your own games:
            using prototypes and delegation for reusing data.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Let's say we're defining the data model for the sameless Gauntlet rip-off I mentioned
            earlier. The game designers need to specify the attributes for monsters and items in some
            kind of files.
            <br>One common approach is to use JSON. Data entities are basically <i>maps</i>, or
            <i>property bags</i>. So a goblin the game might be defined something like this:
            <pre>
            {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                "name": "goblin grunt",
                "minHealth": 20,
                "maxHealth": 30,
                "resists": ["cold", "poison"],
                "weaknesses": ["fire", "light"]
            }
            </pre>
            This is pretty straightforward and eve the most text-adverse designer can handle it.
            So you throw in a couple of sibling branches on the Great Goblin Family Tree:
            <pre>
            {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                "name": "goblin wizard",
                "minHealth": 20,
                "maxHealth": 30,
                "resists": ["cold", "poison"],
                "weaknesses": ["fire", "light"],
                "spells": ["fire ball", "lighting bolt"]
            }
            {
                "name": "goblin archer",
                "minHealth": 20,
                "maxHealth": 30,
                "resists": ["cold", "poison"],
                "weaknesses": ["fire", "light"],
                "attacks": ["short bow"]
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Now, if this was code, our aesthetic sense would be tingling. There's a lot of
            duplication between these entities, and a well-trainined programmer hates that. It
            wastes space and takes more time to author. You have to read carefully to tell if the
            data is even the same. It's a maintenance headache. If we decide to make all of the
            goblins in the game stronger, we need to remember to update the health of all three of
            them. BAD.
            <br>If this was code, we'd create an abstraction for a "goblin" and reuse that across
            the three goblin types. But JSON doesn't know anything about that. So let's make it
            a bit smarter.
            <br>We'll declare that if an object has a "prototype" field, then that defines the
            name of another object that this one delegates to. Any properties that don't exist
            on the first object fall back to being looked up on the prototype.
            <br>This makes the "prototype" a piece of metadata instead of data. Goblins have
            warty green skin and yellow teeth. They don't have prototypes. Prototypes are a
            property of the data object representing the goblin, not the goblin itself.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            With that, we can simplify the JSON for our goblin horde:
            <pre>
            {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                "name": "goblin grunt",
                "minHealth": 20,
                "maxHealth": 30,
                "resists": ["cold", "poison"],
                "weaknesses": ["fire", "light"]
            }
            {
                "name": "goblin wizard",
                "prototype": "goblin grunt",
                "spells": ["fire ball", "lighting bolt"]
            }
            {
                "name": "goblin archer",
                "prototype": "goblin grunt",
                "attacks": ["short bow"]
            }
            </pre>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Since the archer and wizard have the grunt as their prototype, we don't have to
            repeat the health, resists, and weaknesses in each of them. The logic we've
            added to our data model is super simple - basic single delegation - but we've
            already gotten rid of a bunch of duplication.
            <br>One interesting thing to note here is that we didn't set up a fourth "base goblin"
            <i>abstract</i> prototype for the three concrete goblin types to delegate to.
            Instead, we just picked one of the goblins who was the simplest and delegated to it.
            <br>That feels natural in a prototype-based system where any object can be used as
            a clone to create new refined objects, and I think it's equally natural here too.
            It's a particularly good fit for data in games where you often have one-off
            special entities in the game world.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            Think about bosses and unique items. These are often refinements of a more
            commmon object in the game, an prototypal delegation is a good fit for defining those.
            The magic Sword of Head-Detaching, which is really just a longswod with bonuses,
            can be expressed directly as:
            <pre>
            {<span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
                "name": Sword of Head-Detaching",
                "prototype": "longsword",
                "damageBonus": "20"
            }
            </pre>
            A little extra power in your game engine's data modeling system can make it easier
            for designers to add lost of little variations to the armaments and beasties populating
            your game world, and that richness is exactly what delights players.
