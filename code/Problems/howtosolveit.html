    <h2>In the Classroom</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Purpose:</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>1. Helping the student - Help a student naturally. The teacher should put themselves in the studen'ts place and see their case.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>2. Questions, Recommendations, Mental Operations - It will be worth while to collect and to group questions and suggestions which are typically helpful in duscussing problems with students.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>3. Generality - is an important characteristic of the questions and suggestions you collect. Take the questions: <i>What is the unkown?</i> <i>What are the data?</i> <i>What is the condition?</i></p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>4. Common Sense - Our questions and suggestions should be natural, simple, obvious, just plain common sense; but they state plain common sense in general terms.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>5. Imitation and Practice - Trying to solve problems, you have to observe and to imitate what other people do when solving problems and, finally, you leanr to do problems by doing them.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Main Divisions, Main Questions</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>6. Four Phases - In order to group conveniently our questions and suggestions, we shall distinquish four phases of the work.
            <br> &nbsp; 1. Understand the Problem
            <br> &nbsp; 2. Make a Plan
            <br> &nbsp; 3. Carry out the Plan
            <br> &nbsp; 4. Review the Solution</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>7. Understanding the Problems - The student should consider the principal parts of the problem attentively, repeatedly, and from various sides.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>9. Devising a Plan - When creating a plan to solve the problem, there is a series of important questions to ask.
            <br> &nbsp; 1. Do you know any related problems? Look at the unknown. Are there familiar problems having the same or similar unknown? Here is a problem related to yours and solved before. Could you use it?
            <br> &nbsp; 2. Could you restate the problem? Variation of the problem may lead to some appropriate auxiliary problem.
            <br> &nbsp; 3. Did you use all the data? Did you use the whole condition?</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>11. Carry out the Plan - To carry out a plan is much easier than planning the plan; what we need is mainly patience. The important thing to remember is the student should be honestly convinced of the correctness of each step. Ask this question: <i>Can you see clearly that the step is correct? But can you also <b>prove</b> that the step is correct?</i></p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>13. Reviewing the Solutions - There always remains something to do; with sufficient study and penetration, we could improve any solution, and, in any case, we can always improve our understanding of the solution. Ask yourself these questions when reviewing the problem and solution:
            <br> &nbsp; 1. Can you check the result? Can you check the argument?
            <br> &nbsp; 2. Can you derive the result differently?
            <br> &nbsp; 3. Can you see the solution at a glance?
            <br> &nbsp; 4. Can you use the result, or the method, for some other problem?</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span></p>

    <h2>How to Solve It - A Dialogue</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Getting Acquainted</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>Where should I start?</i> Start from the statement of the problem.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>What can I do?</i> Visualize the problem as a whole as clearly and as vividly as you can. Do not concern yourself with details for the moment.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>What can I gain by doing so?</i> You should understand the problem, familiarize yourself with it, impress its purpose on your mind. The attention bestowed on the problem may also stimulate your memory and prepare for the recollection of relevant points.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Working for Better Understanding</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>Where should I start?</i> Start again from the statement of the problem. Start when this statement is so clear to you and so well impressed on your mind that you may lose sight of it for a while without fear of losing it altogether.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>What can I do?</i> Isolate the principal parts of your problem. The hypothesis and the conclusion are the principle parts of a "problem to prove"; the unknown, the data, and the conditions are the principal parts of a "problem to find." Go through the principal parts of your problem, consider them one by one, consider them in turn, consider them in various combinations, relating each detail to other details and each to the whole of the problem.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>What can I gain by doing so?</i> You should prepare and clarify details which are likely to play a role afterwards.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Hunting for the Helpful Idea</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>Where should I start?</i> Start from the consideration of the principal parts of you problem. Start when these principal parts are distinctly arranged and clearly conceived, thanks to your previous work, and when your memory seems responsive.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>What can I do?</i> Consider your problem from various sides and seek contacts with your fomerly acquired knowledge. 
            <br> Consider your problem from various sides. Emphasize different parts, examine different details, examine the same details repeatedly but in different ways, combine the details differently, approach them from different sides. Try to see some new meaning in each detail, some new interpretation of the whole. 
            <br> Seek contacts with your formerly acquired knowledge. Try to think of what helped you in similar situations in the past. Try to recognize something familiar in what you examine, try to perceive something useful in what you recognize.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>What could I perceive?</i> A helpful idea, perhaps a decisive idea that shows you at a glance the way to the very end.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>How can an idea be helpful?</i> It shows you the whole of the way or a part of the way; it suggests to you more or less distinctly how you can proceed. Ideas are more or less complete. You are lucky if you have any idea at all.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>What can I do with an incomplete idea?</i> You should consider it. If it looks advantageous you should consider it longer. If it looks reliable you should ascertain how far it leads you, and reconsider the situation. The situation has changed, thanks to your helpful idea. Consider the new situation from various sides and seek contacts with your formerly acquired knowledge.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>What can I gain by doing so again?</i> You may be lucky and have another idea. Perhaps your next idea will lead you to the solution right away. Perhaps you need a few more helpful ideas after the next. Perhaps you will be led astray by some of your ideas. Nevertheless you should be grateful for all new ideas, also for the lesser ones, also for the hazy ones, also for the supplementary ideas adding some precision to a hazy one, or attempting the correction fo a less fortunate one. Even if you do not have any appreciable new ideas for a while you should be grateful if your conception of the problem becomes more complete or more coherent, more homogeneous or better balanced.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Carrying Out the Plan</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>Where should I start?</i> Start from the lucky idea that led you to the solution. Start when you feel sure of your grasp of the main connection and you feel confident that you can supply the minor details that may be wanting.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>What can I do?</i> Make you grasp quite secure. Carry through in detail all the algebraic or geometric operations which you have recognized previously as feasible. Convince yourself of the correctness of each step by formal reasoning, or by intuitive insight, or both ways if possible. If your problem is very complex you may distinguish "great" steps and "small" steps, each great step being composed of several small ones. Check first the great steps, and get down to the smaller ones afterwards.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>What can I gain by doing so?</i> A presentation of the solution each step of which is correct beyond doubt.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Looking Back</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>Where should I start?</i> From the solution, complete and correct in each detail.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>What can I do?</i> Consider the solution from various sides and seek contacts with your formerly acquired knowledge.
            <br>Consider the details of the solution and try to make them as simple as you can; survey more extensive parts of the solution and try to make them shorter; try to see the whole solution at a glance. Try to modify to their advantage smaller or larger parts of the solution, try ot improve the whole solution, to make it intuitive, to fit it into your formerly acquired knowledge as naturally as possible. Scruitinize the method that led you to the solution, try to see its point, and try to make use of it for other problems. Scruitinize the result and try to make use of it for other problems.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>What can I gain by doing so?</i> You may find a new and better solution, you may discover new and interesting facts. In any case, if you get into the habit of surveying and scrutinizing your solutions in this way, you will acquire some knowledge well ordered and ready to use, and you will develop your ability of solving problems.</p>

            <h3>Analogy</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Sort of similarity. Similar objects agree with each other in some respect, analogous objects <i>agree in certain relations</i> of their respective parts.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>1. We may consider ourselves lucky when, trying to solve a problem, we succeed in discovering a <i>simpler analogous problem.</i> You may then have two questions instead of one, but two questions may be easier to answer than just one - provided that the two questions are intelligently connected.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>2. In solving a proposed problem, we can often use the solution of a simpler analogous problem; we may be able to use its method, or its result, or both.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>3. It is desirable to forsee the result, or, at least, some features of the result, with some degree of plausibility. Such plasible forecasts are often based on analogy.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>4. An analogical conclusion from many parallel cases is stronger than one from fewer cases. Yet quality is still more important here than quantity. Clear-cut analogies weigh more heavily than vague similarities, systematically arranged instances count for more than random collections of cases.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>5. Take two systems of objects, say S and S`, are so connected that certain relations between the objects of S are governed by the same laws as those between the objects of S`. 
            <br>There is a one-to-one correspondence between the objects of the two systems S and S`, preserving certain relations. That is, if such relation holds between the objects of one system, the same relation holds between the corresponding object of the other system. Such a connection between two systems is a very precise sort of analogy; it is called <b>isomorphism</b> (or holohedral isomorphism).
            <br>There is a one-to-many correspondence between the objects of the two systems S and S` preserving certain relations. Such a connection is called <b>merohedral isomorphism</b>> (or homomorphism).</p>

            <h3>Auxiliary Elements</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>As our work progresses, we add new elements to those originally considered. An element that we introduce in the hope that it will further the solution is called an <i>auxiliary element.</i></p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>1. An <i>auxiliary theorem</i> is a theorem whose proof we undertake in the hope of promoting the solution of our original problem.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>2. There are various reasons for introducting auxiliary elements. We are glad when we have succeeded in recollecting <i>problem related to ours and solved before.</i> It is probable that we can use such a problem but we do not know yet how to use it.</p>

            <h3>Auxiliary Problems</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>A problem which we consider not for its own sake, but because we hope that its consideration may help us to solve another problem, our original problem. The original problem is the end we wish to attain, the auxiliary problem is a means by which we try to attain our end.</p>
