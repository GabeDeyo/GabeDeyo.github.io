                    map.put(s.getId(), s);

            <h3>ArrayList (Dynamically Resizing Array)</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>An ArrayList, or a dynamically resizing array, is an array that resizes itself as needed while still providing O(1) access. A typical implementation is that when a vector is full, the array doubles in size. Each doubling takes O(n) time, but happens so rarely that its amortized time is still O(1)</p>
            <pre>
            <span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>public ArrayList&lt;String&gt; merge(String[] words, String[] more) {

                    sentence.add(w);

            <h3>StringBuffer / StringBuilder</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>Questions:</b> What is the running time of this code?</p>
            <pre>
            <span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>public String makeSentence(String[] words) {

            }
            </pre>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>Answer: O(n^2),</b> where n is the number of letters in the sentence. Here's why: each time you append a string to a sentence, you create a copy of sentence and run through all the letters in sentence to copy them over. If you have to iterate through up to n characters each time in the loop, and you're looping at least n times, that gives you an O(n^2) run time. Ouch. Review StringBuffer or StringBuilder to see remedies to this situation.</p>

            <h3>How to Approach</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Linked list questions are extremely common. These can range from simple (delete a node in a linked list) to much more challenging. Either way, we advise you to be extremely comfortable with the easiest questions. Being able to easily manipulate a linked list in the simplest ways will make the tougher linked list questions much less tricky. With that said, I'll present some "must know" code about linked list manipulation. You should be able to easily write this code yourself prior to your interview.</p>

            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>3.1</b> Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>3.2</b> How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, also has a function min which returns the miminum element? Push, pop and min should all operate O(1) time.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>3.3</b> Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks, and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).

            <br> &nbsp; (A) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
            <br> &nbsp; (B) A disk is slid off the top of one rod onto the next rod.
            <br> &nbsp; (C) A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.
            <br>Write a program to move the disks from the first rod to the last using Stacks.</p>

            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>When given a binary tree questions, many candidates assume that the interviewer means "binary <i>search</i> tree", when the interviewer might only mean "binary tree". So, listen carefully for that word "search". If you don't hear it, the interviewer may just mean a binary tree with no particular ordering on the nodes. If you aren't sure, ask.</p>

    <h2>Brain Teasers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Do companies really ask brain teasers?</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>While many companies, including Google and Microsoft, have policies banning brain teasers, interviewers still sometimes ask these tricky questions. This is especially true since people have different definitions of brain teasers.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Approaching Brain Teasers</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Dont' panic when you get a brain teaser. Interviewers want to see how you tackle a problem; they don't expect you to immediately know the answer. Start talking, and show the interviewer how you approach a problem.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>In many cases, you will also find that the brain teasers have some connection back to fundamental laws or theories of computer science.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>If you're stuck, I recommend simplifying the problem. Solve it for a small number of items or a special case, and see if you can generalize it.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>You are trying to cook an egg for exactly 15 minutes, but instead of a timer, you are given two ropes which burn for exactly 1 hour each. The ropes, however are of uneven densities - i.e., half the rope length-wise might only take only two minutes to burn.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>The Approach</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>1. What is important? Numbers usually have meaning behind them. The 15 minutes and two ropes were picked for a reason.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>2. Simplify! You can easily time one hour (burn just one rope).</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>3. Now, can you time 30 minutes? That's half the time it takes to burn one rope. Can you burn the rope twice as fast? Yes! (Light the rope at both ends)</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>4. You've now learned: (1) You can time 30 minutes. (2) You can burn a rope that takes X minutes in just X/2 minutes by lighting both ends.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>5. work backwards: If you had a rope of burn-length 30 minutes, that would let you time 15 minutes. Can you remove 30 minutes of burn-time from a rope?</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>6. You can remove 30 minutes of burn-time from Rope #2 by lighting Rope #1 at both ends and Rope #2 at one end.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>7. Now that you have Rope #2 at burn-length 30 minutes, start cooking the egg and light Rope #2 at the other end. When Rope #2 burns, up your egg is done.</p>
        </p></li>

            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>6.3</b> You have a five quart jug and a three quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).

If there are n people and c hats, how long does it take the men to remove the hats? The men cannot tell each other (in any way) that they have a hat.

            <h3>How to Approach</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Object oriented design questions are very important, as they demonstrate the quality of a candidate's code. A poor performance on this type of questions raises serious red flags.</p>

            <h3>Handling Ambiguity in an Interview</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>OOD questions are often intentionally vague to test if you'll make assumptions, or if you'll ask clarifying questions. How do you design a class if the constraints are vague? Ask questions to eliminate ambiguity, then design the classes to handle any remaining ambiguity.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Object Oriented Design for Software</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Imagine we're desiging the object for a deck of cards. Consider the following approach:</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>1. What are you trying to do with the deck of cards? Ask your interviewer. Let's assume we want a general purpose deck of cards to implement many different types of card games.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>2. What are the core objects - and what "sub types" ar there? For example, the core items might be: Card, Deck, Number, Suit, PointValue.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>3. Have you missed anything? Think about how you'll use that deck of cards to implement different types of games, changing the class design as necessary.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>4. Now, get a little deeper: how will the methods work? If you have a method like CardDeck::getCard(Suit s, Number n), think about how it will retrieve the card.</p>

            <h3>Object Oriented Design for Real World Objects</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Real world objects are handled very similarly to software object oriented design. Suppose you are designing an object oriented design for a parking lot.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>1. What are your goals? For example: figure our if a parking spot is taken, figure out how many cars of each type are in the parking lot, look up handicapped spots, etc.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>2. Now, think about the core objects(Car, ParkingSpot, ParkingLot, ParkingMeter, etc - Car has different subclasses, and ParkingSpot is also subclassed for handicapped spot).</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>3. Have we missed anything? How will we represent parking restrictions based on time or payment? Perhaps, we'll add a class called Permission which handles different payment systems. Permission will be subclassed into classes PaidPermission (fee to park) and FreeParking (open parking). ParkingLot will have a method called GetPermission which will return the current Permission object based on the time.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>4. How will we know whether or not a car is in the spot? Think about how to represent the data so that the mothods are efficient.</p>

    <h2>Recursion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>How to Recognize</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>While there is a wide variety of recursive problems, many recursive problems follow similar patterns. A good hint that a problem is recursive is that it appears to be built off sub-problems.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>When you hear a problem beginning with the following, it's often (though not always) a good candidate for recursion: "Design an algorithm to compute the nth..."; "Write code to list the first n..."; "Implement a method to compute all..."; etc.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Again, practice makes perfect! The more problems you do, the easier these will be to recognize.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>How to Approach</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Recursive solutions, by definition, are built off solutions to sub-problems. Many times, this will mean simply to compute f(n) by adding something, removing something, or otherwise changing the solution for f(n-1). In other cases, you might have to do something more complicated. Regardless, I recommend the following approach.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>1. Think about what the sub-problem is. How many sub-problems does f(n) depend on? That is, in a recursive binary tree problem, each part will likely depend on two problems. In a linked list problem, it'll probably just be one.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>2. Solve for a "base case". That is, if you need to compute f(n), first compute it for f(0) or f(1). This is usually just a hard-coded value.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>3. Solve for f(2).</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>4. Understand how to solve for f(3) using f(2) (or previous solutions). That is, understanding the exact process of translating the solution for sub-problems into the real solution.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Generalie for f(n).</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>This "bottom-up recursion" is often the most straight-forward. Sometimes, though, it can be useful to approach problems "top down", where you essentially jump directly into breaking f(n) into its sub-problems.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Things to Watch Out For</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>1. All problems that can be solved recursively can also be solved iteratively (though the code may be much more complicated). Before diving into a recursive code, ask yourself how hard it would be to implement this algorithm iteratively. Discuss the trade-offs with your interviewer.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>2. Recursive algorithms can be very space inefficient. Each recursive call adds a new layer to the stack, which means that if your algorithm has O(n) recursive calls then it uses O(n) memory. Not Good! This is one reason why an iterative algorithm may be better.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Problems</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>8.1</b> Write a method to generate the nth Fibonacci number.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>8.2</b> Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left hand corner of an NxN grid. The robot can only move in two directions: right and down.

    <h2>Sorting and Searching</h2>

            <h3>How to Approach</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Understanding the common sorting algorithms is incredibly valuable, as many sorting or searching solutions require tweaks of known sorting algorithms. A good approach when you are given a question like this is to run through the different sorting algorithms and see if one applies particularly well.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>Example:</i> You have a very large array of 'Person' objects. Sort the people in increasing order of age.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>We're given two interesting bits of knowledge here: (1) It's a large array, so efficiency is very important. (2) We are sorting based on ages, so we know the values are in a smaller range. By scanning through the various sorting algorithms, we might notice that bucket sort would be a perfect candidate for this algorithm. In fact, we can make the buckets small (just 1 year each) and get O(n) running time.</p>
        </p></li>

            <h3>Bubble Sort</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Start at the beginning of an array and swap the first two elements if the first is bigger than the second. Go to the next pair, etc, continuously making sweeps of the array until stored. O(n^2).</p>

            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Find the smallest element using a linear scan and moe it to the front. Then, find the second smallest and move it, again doing a linear scan. continue doing this until all elements are in place.</p>

            <h3>Quick Sort</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Pick a random element and partition the array, such that all numbers that are less than it come before all elements that are greater than it. Then do that for each half, then each quarter, etc. O(n * log(n)) expected, O(n^2) worst case.</p>
        </p></li>

            <h3>Bucket Sort</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Partition the array into a finite number of buckets, and then sort each bucket individually. This gives a time of O(n+m), where n is the number of items and m is the number of distinct items.</p>

            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Many of these problems are read as brain teasers at first, but can be worked through in a logical way. Just remember to rely on the rules of mathematics to develop an approach, and then to carefully translate that idea into code.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>Example:</i> Given two numbers m and n, write a method to return the first number r that is divisible by both (e.g., the least common multiple)</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>The Approach:</i> What does it mean for r to be divisible by m and n? It means that all the primes in m must go into r, and all primes in n must be in r. What if m and n have primes in common? For example, if m is divisible by 3^5 and n is divisible by 3^7, what does this mean about r? It means r must be divisible by 3^7.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>The Rule:</i> For each prime p such that p^a \ m (e.g., m is divisible by p^a) and p^b \ n, r must be divisible by p^max(a,b).</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>The Algorithm:</i></p>
            <pre>
            <span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Define q to be 1.
            for each prime number p less than m and n:
                find the largest a and b such that p^a \ m and p^b \ n
                let q = q * p^max(a,b)
            return q
            </pre>
        </p></li>

            <h3>Things to Watch Out For</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>1. Be careful with the difference in precision between floats vs doubles.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>2. Don't assume that a value (such as the slope of a line) is an int unless you've been told so.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Bayes' Rule and Probability</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>1. If A and B are independent, then P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>2. Else (in general), P(A and B) = P(A given B) * P(B)</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>3. If A and B are mutually exclusive (e.g., if one happens, the other one can't), P(A OR B) = P(A) + P(B)</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>4. Else (in general), P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)</p>
        </p></li>

            <h3>Testing Problems: Not Just for Testers</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Although testers are obviously asked more testing problems, developers will often be asked testing problems as well. Why? Because a good developer knows how to test their code!</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Types of Testing Problems</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Testing problems generally fall into one of three categories:
            <br> &nbsp; 1. Explain how you would test this real world object (pen, paperclip, etc).
            <br> &nbsp; 2. Explain how you would test this computer software (e.g., a web browser).
            <br> &nbsp; 3. Write test cases / test code to test this specific method.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>We'll discuss type #1, since it's usually the most daunting. Remember that all thre types require you to not make assumptions that the input or the user will play nice. Expect abuse and plan for it.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>How to Test A Real World Object</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Let's imagine that you were asked to test a paperclip. The first thing to understand is: what is it expected to be used for and who are the expected users. Ask your interviewer - the answer may not be what you think! The answer could be "by teachers, to hold papers together" or it could be "by artists, to bend into new shapes." These two use-cases will have very different answers. Once you understand the intended use, think about these thins.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>What are the specific use cases for the intended purpose? For example, holding 2 sheets of paper together, and up to 30 sheets. If it fails, does it fail gracefully?</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>What does it mean for it to fail? Answer: "Failing gracefully" means for the paperclip to not hold paper together. If it snaps easily, that's proably not failing gracefully.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Ask your interviewer - what are the expectations of it being used outside of the intended use case? Should we ensure that it has a minimum of usefulness for the other cases?</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>What "stress" conditions might your paper clip be used in? <i>Answer:</i> hot weather, cold weather, frequent re-use, etc.</p>

    <h2>System Design and Memory Limits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>How to Approach</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Don't be scared by these types of questions. Unless you claim to know how to design large systems, your interviewer probably won't expect you to know this stuff automatically. They just want to see how you tackle these problems.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>General Approach</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>The general approach is as follows: Imagine we're designing a hypothetical system X for millions of items (users, files, megabtyes, etc):</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span> &nbsp; 1. How would you solve it for a small number of items? Develop an algorithm for this case, which is often pretty straight-forward.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span> &nbsp; 2. What happens when you try to implement that algorithm with millions of items? It's likely hat you have run out of space on the computer. So, divide up the files across many computers.
            <br> &nbsp; &bull; How do you divide up data across many machines? That is, do the first 100 items appear on the same computer? Or all items withthe same hash value mod 100?
            <br> &nbsp; &bull; About how many computers will you need? To estimate this, ask how big each item is and take a guess at how much space a typical computer has.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span> &nbsp; 3. Now, fix the problems that occur when you are using many computers. Make sure to answer the following questions:
            <br> &nbsp; &bull; How does one machine know which machine it should access to look up data?
            <br> &nbsp; &bull; Can data get out of sync across computer? How do you handle that?
            <br> &nbsp; &bull; How can you minimize expensive reads across computers?</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Example: Design a Web Crawler</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>1. Forget the fact that you're dealing with billions of pages. How would you design this system if it were just a small number of pages? You should have an understanding of how you would solve the simple, small case in order to understand how you would solve the bigger case.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>2. Now, think about the issues that occur with billions of pages. Most likely you can't fit that data on one machine. How will you divide it up? How will you figure out which computer has a particular piece of data?</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>You now have different pieces of data on different machines. What problems might that create? Can you try to solve them?</p>

The feed is delivered once per trading day in a comma-separated format via an FTP site. The feed will be used by 1000 daily users in a web application.</p>

            <h3>How to Approach</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>A good interviewer won't demand that you cod in a language you don't profess to know. Hopefully, if you're asked to code in C++, it's listed on your resume. If you don't remember all the APIs, don't worry - your interviewer probably doesn't care that much. We do recommend, however, studying up on basic C++ syntax.</p>

            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>A very common question in an interview is "describe the differences between C++ and Java". If you aren't comfortable with any of these concepts, we recommend reading up on them.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>1. Java runs in a virtual machine.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>2. C++ natively supports unsigned arithmetic.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>3. In Java, parameters are always passed by value (or, with objects, their references are passed by value). In C++, paramters can be passed by value, pointer, or by reference.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>4. Java has built-in garbage collection.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>5. C++ allows operator overloading.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>6. C++ allows multiple inheritance of classes.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Question: Which of these might be considered strengths or weaknesses of C++ or Java? Why? In what cases might you choose one language over the other?</p>

            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>What are the key objects?</i>
            <br> &nbsp; Property. Building. Apartment. Tenant. Manager.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><i>How do they relate to each other?</i>
            <br> &nbsp; Many-to-Many
            <br> &nbsp; &bull; A property could have multiple managers, and a manager could manage multiple properties.
            <br> &nbsp; One-to-Many:
            <br> &nbsp; &bull; A building can only be part of one property.

            <h3>Large Database Design</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>When designing a large, scalable database, joins (which are required in the above examples), are generally very slow. Thus, you mus <i>denormalize</i> your data. Think carefully about how data will be used - you'll probably need to duplicate it in multiple tables.</p>

    <h2>Low Level</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>How to Approach</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Many candidates find low level problems to be some of the most challenging. Low level questions require a large amount of knowledge about the underlying architecture of a system. But just how much do you need to know? The answer to that depends, of course, on the company. At a typical large software company where you'd be working on desktop or web application, you usually only need to know a minimum amount of knowledge. However, you should understand the concepts below very well, as many interview questions are based off this information.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Big vs. Little Endian</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>In big endian, the most significant byte is store at the memory address location with the lowest address. This is akin to left-to-right reading order. Little endian is the reverse: the most significant byte is stored at the address with the highest address.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Stack (Memory)</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>When a function calls another function which calls another function, this memory goes onto the stack. An int (not a pointer to an int) that is created in a function is stored on the stack.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Heap (Memory)</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>When you allocate data with new() or malloc(), this data gets stored on the heap.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Malloc</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Memory allocated using malloc is persistent - i.e., it will exist until either the programmer frees the memory or the program is terminated.
            <pre>void *malloc(size_t sz)</pre>
            Malloc takes as input sz bytes of memory and, if it is successful, returns a void pointer which indicates that it is a pointer to an unknown data type.
            <pre>void free(void * p)</pre>
            Free releases a block of memory previously allocated with malloc, calloc, or realloc.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Problems</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>16.1</b> Explain the following terms: virtual memory, page fault, thrashing.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>16.2</b> What is a Branch Target buffer? Explain how it can be used in reducing bubble cycles in cases of branch misdirection.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>16.3</b> Describe direct memory access (DMA). Can a user level buffer / pointer be used by kernel or drivers?</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>16.4</b> Write a step by step execution of things that happen after a user presses a key on the keyboard. Use as much detail as possible.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>16.5</b> Write a program to find whether a machine is big endian or little endian.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>16.6</b> Discuss how would you make sure that a process doesn't access an unauthorized part of the stack.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>16.7</b> What are the best practices to prevent reverse engineering of DLLs?</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>16.8</b> A device boots with an empty FIFO queue. In the first 300 ns period after startup, and in in each subsequent 400 ns perios, a maximum of 80 words will be written to the queue. Each write takes 4 ns. A worker thread requires 3 ns to read a word, and 2 ns to process it before reading the next word. What is the shortest depth of the FIFO such that no data is lost?</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>16.9</b> Write an aligned malloc &amp; free function that takes number of bytes and aligned byte (which is always power of 2)
            <br> EXAMPLE:
            <br> &nbsp; align_malloc(1000, 128) will return a memory address that is a multiple of 128 and that points to memory of size 1000 bytes.
            <br> &nbsp; aligned_free() will free memory allocated by align_malloc.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>16.10</b> Write a function called my2DAlloc which allocates a two dimensional array. Minimize the number of calls to malloc and make sure the memory is accessible by the notation arr[i][j].</p>

            <h3>How to Approach</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>While the big software houses probably won't ask you many detailed networking questions in general, some interviewers will attempt to assess your understanding of networking as far as it relates to software and system design.

    <h2>Threads and Locks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>How to Approach</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>In a Microsoft, Google or Amazon interview, it's not terribly common to be asked to implement an algorithm with threads (unless you're working in a team for wich this is a particularly important skill). It is, however, relatively common for interviewers at any company to asses your general understanding of threads, particularly your understanding of deadlocks.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Deadlock Conditions</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>In order for a deadlock to occur, you must have the following four conditions met:</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>1. Mutual Exclusion: Only one process can use resource at a given time.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>2. Hold and Wait: Processes already holding a resource can request new ones.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>3. No Preemption: One process cannot forcibly remove another process' resource.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>4. Circular Wait: Two or more processes form a circular chain where each process is waiting on another resource in the chain.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li><p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>
            <h3>Deadlock Prevention</h3>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>Deadlock prevention essentially entails removing one of the above conditions, but many of these conditions are difficult to satisfy. For instance, removing #1 is difficult because many resources can only be used by one process at a time (printers, etc). Most deadlock prevention algorithms focus on avoiding condition #4: circular wait.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span>If you aren't familiar with these concepts, please read <a href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock</a>.</p>

            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>20.10</b> Given two words of equal length that are in a dictionary, write a method to transform one word into another word by changing only one letter at a time. The new word you get in each step must be in the dictionary.
            <br> EXAMPLE:
            <br> INPUT: DAMP, LIKE
            <br> OUTPUT: DAMP -> LAMP -> LIMP -> LIME -> LIKE</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>20.11</b> Imagine you have a square matrix, where each cell is filled with either black or white. Design and algorithm to find the maximum subsquare such that all four borders are filled with black pixels.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>20.12</b> Given an NxN matrix of positive and negative integers, write code to find the sub-matrix with the largest possible sum.</p>
            <p><span class="glyphicon-remove"></span><b>20.13</b> Given a dictionary of millions of words, give an algorithm to find the largest possible rectangle of letters such that every row forms a word (reading left to right) and every column forms a word (reading top to bottom).</p>
